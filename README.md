### Hello everyone 👋

#### A really short intro about me! :P

- I'm a Java Backend Developer and DevOps Engineer who is in love with the Java ecosystem always looking for new features in versión releases, understand functions algorithm, implementing services in the cloud, continuous integrations/delivery pipelines-functions and learning about SRE.

- 🔭 I have experience with technologies like Java, Spring (Boot), Jenkins, Linux and creating-deploying applications on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), hands-on various services like Cloud Storage (Buckets, DataStore, SQL), App Engine, Pub-Sub, Monitoring and Error Reporting Suite, Computer Engine and learning; currently working on event-driven architectures and microservice ones.

- Python is my principal algorithm or solutions solver to use in really microservices, Functions as a Service (FaaS), deploying Machine Learning models with Flask and Data Science stuff with Pandas, Seaborn, Cufflinks, ScikitLearn, Matplotlib, Joblib libraries...

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Micronaut, Quarkus, Play, Flask, Django, SRE, getting into DevOps philosophy, Docker, Kubernetes and all relative with Reactive programming with Reactor Project / RxJava.
